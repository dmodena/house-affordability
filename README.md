# Housing Affordability in London

## Project Overview

This is a collaborative project aimed at analyzing the affordability of housing in London. The project is divided into multiple components, with each team member working on a specific part independently. All contributions will be integrated at the end of the project.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following folders:

- **affordability-chart/** - Visualizations and charts related to housing affordability metrics
- **calculator/** - Tools and calculators for affordability analysis
- **gap-chart/** - Charts displaying affordability gaps
- **life-expectancy/** - Analysis of housing affordability versus life expectancy
- **map/** - Geographic visualizations and mapping data
- **reasons-solutions/** - Analysis of causes and potential solutions to affordability issues

## Collaboration Guidelines

### Working Within Your Folder

Each team member is responsible for one specific folder. All your work must be contained within your assigned folder:

- Do not modify files outside your folder without explicit team discussion
- Keep your folder organized and well-documented
- Ensure your code/work is self-contained and can function independently
- Update the documentation within your folder as you develop

### Git Workflow: Fork → Work → Pull Request

We use a standard Git-based collaborative workflow:

#### 1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Fork this repository to your personal GitHub account
   - This creates your own copy where you can work freely

#### 2. **Clone and Work**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/house-affordability.git
   cd house-affordability
   ```
   - Work exclusively within your assigned folder
   - Create a feature branch for your work:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
     ```
   - Make regular commits with clear messages describing your changes

#### 3. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**
   - Push your changes to your forked repository
   - On GitHub, submit a Pull Request to the main repository
   - In your PR description, include:
     - Summary of changes made
     - What folder you worked in
     - Any dependencies or setup instructions
     - Known issues or limitations (if any)
   - Request a code review from a team member
   - Address feedback and make necessary adjustments
   - Once approved, your PR will be merged

### Best Practices

- **Communicate**: Inform the team which folder you're working on and any dependencies on other parts
- **Document**: Include README or documentation files within your folder explaining your work
- **Test**: Ensure your code/analysis works independently before submitting
- **Commit Often**: Make small, meaningful commits rather than one large commit
- **Pull Regularly**: Keep your local copy updated with the latest changes from the main repository
- **Review Code**: Participate in reviewing teammates' pull requests

## Getting Started

1. Fork the project on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Check out your assigned folder
4. Begin development on your component
5. Submit a pull request when ready for integration

**Project Goal**: Comprehensive analysis and visualization of housing affordability trends in London
